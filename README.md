# community_store_sagepay
integrate SagePay payment system into Community Store for concrete5

Supports both Server and Form integration

With the server integration you can void, refund payments through the dashboard, orders -> sage Pay

TODO
Send the basket to Sage pay
This is now done, if you use product options with different prices the tax value will be incorrect. This is fixed in the core community store but will have to wait for the next version
